# LiDAR To Bump Node
This package uses data from the TRINA2 lidar sensor to attempt to identify bump hazards that move result in difficult to escape situations for the remote operator. This node subscribes to the LiDAR point cloud and publishes an angle of the estimated bump hazard with respect to the robot if one exists. Please see the diagram below for a description of the bump angle with respect to the robot.
